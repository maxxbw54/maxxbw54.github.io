         <h3>Basics about How to write Threats to Validity Section</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Threats to <b>construct</b> validity are concerned with the relationship between theory and observation.<br>
            <b>EXAMPLE</b>: You design some heuristics to build a dataset (e.g., for code reuse) and draw conclusion (about code reuse) on the dataset. But your heuristics may not cover all the code reuse scenarios. </li>
            <li>Threats to <b>internal</b> validity are concerned with the factors that may affect a dependent variable and were not considered in the study.<br>
            <b>EXAMPLE</b>: You consider a paper as a baseline, and the paper does not release its replication package. so you replicate/re-implement the baseline based on your understanding on the paper. </li>
            <li>Threats to <b>conclusion</b> validity are concerned with the relationship between the treatment and the outcome.<br>
            <b>EXAMPLE</b>: You conduct some manual labeling in your work. Does your manual label process can guarantee the correctness of all the cases?</li>
            <li>Threats to <b>external</b> validity are concerned with the generalizability of our results.<br>
            <b>EXAMPLE</b>: Your experiment is conducted in Java, are your findings/conclusions also hold in other PLs?</li>
         </ul>

         Another good way to learn how to write is to read the "Threats to Validity" section of the related works. <br>
         Please do <b>NOT</b> use "internal threat" to refer to "Threats to internal validity". It's simply <b>WRONG</b>.
