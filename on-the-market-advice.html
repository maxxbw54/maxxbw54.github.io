      <h1>A checklist if you plan to be on the market
      </h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Get your VISA ready to the countries you apply. (My on-site interviews have to be delayed due to the VISA issue.)</li>
    </ol>

      <h1>A checklist (lessons I learned) if you are looking for a job during a conference
      </h1>

      <ol>
        <li>Know who are hiring, i.e., your "targets".</li>
        <li>Prepare a brief (less than 1 min) self-introduction when you meet your targets. Make sure it covers all your strengths but don't overprepare it.</li>
        <li>Ask a question in the keynote QA session, you will get good exposure and impression, don't be shy.</li>
        <li>Invite your targets to attend your presentation (most of the time, they will come). Prepare your presentation very well including QA, of course.</li>
        <li>Spend a few seconds thinking before you answer questions from your target, and keep as calm as you can.</li>
        <li>Even greater if you can chat with a big smile! :)</li>
    </ol>

      Good luck! &#129310;
